  excerpt: "Integrative Biology Lab at CNB" 
#  - excerpt: 'When we find a landmark (in Spanish, “hito”), we do not only see a bunch of stones. We know that it is extremely unlikely to find them in such position, and a meaning immediately emerges. This is a nice metaphor explaining my motivation for Biology, because it contains the most intriguing questions surrounding the origin and evolution of life: Why  does life seem to run away from high entropy states? Why does it spontaneously create and store information? How can we model the emergent patterns arising from biological processes? On this website, you can find information about my research and some more… Welcome!'

Science's understanding of biological phenomena in this century has expanded dramatically thanks to the development of new technologies such as massive sequencing and nanometric techniques. This vast knowledge makes it imperative that we invest efforts in **integrating diverse information in the search for solid principles** on which biology is based. 

In our lab, we work with this motivation in mind (but please note [this disclaimer](_pages/Disclaimer.md)) by trying to study **biological phenomena across scales**, epistemological approaches (e.g. top-down vs. bottom-up), and theoretical, computational and experimental methods. This integrative approach can be naturally developed in our favourite system, microbial communities, where molecular, cellular and population phenomena converge. Our long-term goal is to project our knowledge towards the development of **biotechnological applications** that address **challenges of our time**. Welcome!
