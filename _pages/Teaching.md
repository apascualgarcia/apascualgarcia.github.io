intro: 
#  - excerpt: 'I am physicist with (real) interest in biology. I did my PhD in the Center for Molecular Biology Severo Ochoa in Madrid (CSIC-UAM) under the supervision of [Dr. Ugo Bastolla](https://ub.cbm.uam.es/). I moved then to the Microbial Ecology laboratory of Imperial College London, leaded by [Dr. Thomas Bell](https://bellmicrobelab.wordpress.com/), where I am Research Associate. I focus on complex biological systems at different scales, from molecules to large ecosystems, considering experimental data whenever is possible. In the following, I briefly describe some areas of interest, from microscopic to macroscopic systems.'
