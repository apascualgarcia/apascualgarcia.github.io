intro: 
  - excerpt: 'I am physicist with (real) interest in biology. I did my PhD in the Center for Molecular Biology Severo Ochoa in Madrid (CSIC-UAM) under the supervision of Dr. Ugo Bastolla. I moved then to
  the Microbial Ecology laboratory of Imperial College London leaded by Dr. Thomas Bell where I am Research Associate. I focus on complex biological systems at different scales, from molecules to large ecosystems, and I like to consider experimental data whenever is possible. In the following, I briefly describe some areas of interest, from microscopic to macroscopic systems.'

    excerpt: 'The vast number and ubiquity of microbes makes them vital for a variety of processes, from global carbon balance to antibiotic pathogenesis. However, we are still far from having a clear picture of the ecological and evolutionary determinants shaping bacterial communities, which is necessary for the control and further development of any potential application. I am interested in the integration of top-down and bottom-up computational methods, combining statistical analysis from natural samples and genome-based models. My aim is to shed light in the complex relation between bacterial biodiversity and community function.'

    title: "Placeholder Image Center Aligned"
    excerpt: 'I am also interested in the epistemological questions surrounding the study of complex systems. In particular, I am developing a novel approximation based on intuitionistic logic, aiming to provide a sharp definition of the concept of emergence, a question that has attracted much controversy in the literature.'
