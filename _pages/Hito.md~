intro: 
  - excerpt: 'When we find a landmark (in Spanish "hito") we do not just see a bunch of stones. We know that
it is extremely unlikely to find them in that position unless a living being
stacked them on purpose. This is a nice metaphor explaining my research interests,
namely why life seems to run away from highly entropic states, why it spontaneously creates
and stores information, and whether we are able to understand the emergent patterns arising from these processes.
In this website you will find information about my research and some more... Welcome!.'
