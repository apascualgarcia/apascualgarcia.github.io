## Research Assistant/Ph.D. in Computational Microbiology

Madrid, October 2023

The [Integrative Biology Lab](https://apascualgarcia.github.io/) at the [Spanish National Centre for Biotechnology](https://www.cnb.csic.es/index.php/en/) (CNB) in Madrid (Spain) is looking for a Research Assistant to start inmediately, with the possibility of doing a Ph.D. The scientist will participate in a project that combines theoretical and empirical techniques to explore the mechanisms underlying the assembly and maintenance of natural microbial communities. To achieve this goal, the lab studies strategies to reproducibly culture natural microbial communities that are then simplified and analysed. Our long-term goal is to create a library of domesticated consortia to unravel the principles of microbial organisation and develop biotechnological applications from them.

The scientist will benefit from being fully integrated in the international network of scientific collaborations of the PI Dr. Pascual-García. In particular, the project will be developed in collaboration with Prof. Thomas Bell (Imperial College London), Dr. Magdalena San-Román (CNB, Álvaro Sanchez lab) and Dr. Josep Ramoneda (Noah Fierer lab, U. Colorado Boulder).

**Your responsibilities**:

  - Conduct research and develop theoretical and computational models to characterize microbial interaction mechanisms under the supervision of the PI.

  - Actively engage in the activities in the Lab and CNB, having a proactive and positive attitude.

  - (if PhD) Progressively develop your own scientific ideas to become an autonomous scientist.

  - (if PhD) Complete a consistent project to achieve a Ph.D. degree.

**Your profile**:

  - Must have completed a bachelor's degree in a quantitative field such as Physics, Mathematics or Computer Science or, if you have a background in Biology, a Master's degree in Computer Science or related fields.

  - Must have completed a Master's degree.

  - You have a genuine interest in learning about biological systems.

  - You enjoy acquiring new skills and are open to new challenges away from your comfort zone.

  - You are fluent in English.

  - You are a communicative and open person and are willing to work in a team.

**We offer**:

  - A funded position for 3 years with the possibility of an extension for a further 1 year if a Ph.D. is pursued.

  - A remuneration according to the Spanish Research Council for Research Assistants (14 payments per year of ~1.650 € before taxes). 

  - Training not only in scientific but also in meta-scientific aspects, with emphasis on career development.

  - (if Ph.D.) You will join a PhD Programme at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, within the same CNB campus. 

  - (if Ph.D.) Incorporation into the CNB Training Programme to complement the skills acquired in the laboratory and in the PhD programmes.


If you are interested in this position please send your CV and a Letter of Motivation explaining your scientific motivations and, in particular, the reasons why you might be willing to join the Integrative Biology lab. Please, include in your CV contact details of two people who could provide reference letters.

Please send both documents in pdf format to alberto.pascual.garcia AT gmail DOT com including in the subject line "Research Assistant Integrative Biology" before **November 20th**. Applications will be reviewed and will continue until the position is filled.
