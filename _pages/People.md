#intro: 
#  - excerpt: 'I am physicist with (real) interest in biology. I did my PhD in the Center for Molecular Biology Severo Ochoa in Madrid (CSIC-UAM) under the supervision of [Dr. Ugo Bastolla](https://ub.cbm.uam.es/). Then I joined the Microbial Ecology laboratory of Imperial College London, led by [Prof. Thomas Bell](https://bellmicrobelab.wordpress.com/), and where I am still External Lecturer in the MSc of Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution. I am currently a member of the Theoretical Biology group at ETH-Zürich, led by  [Prof. Sebastian Bonhoeffer](www.tb.ethz.ch). I focus on complex biological systems at the different scales, from molecules to large ecosystems, with special emphasis on microbial ecology, and considering experimental data whenever is possible. In the following, I briefly describe some areas of interest.'

I was a Fellow at the [Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin](https://www.wiko-berlin.de/) in 2021-2022, and I moved back to Spain in 2023 to lead the Integrative Biology laboratory at the [National Centre for Biotechnology](https://www.cnb.csic.es/index.php/en/).'

#    excerpt: 'The relationship between biodiversity and stability in complex ecosystems has undergone a long debate involving intense theoretical research. I am interested in deciphering which is the role that the different species interactions have on this relationship, with particular emphasis on mutualistic interactions. Mutualism has been historically considered detrimental for biodiversity, overemphasizing the role of competition. We are challenging this view with a fresh perspective based on the importance of structural stability.'
